Description: An implementation of reliability estimation methods described in the paper (Bosnic, Z., & Kononenko, I. (2008) <doi:10.1007/s10489-007-0084-9>), which allows you to test the reliability of a single predicted instance made
             by your model and prediction function. It also allows you to make a correlation test to estimate which reliability estimate is the most 
             accurate for your model.
